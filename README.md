Multilingual Text Translation Tool

Technologies: Python, Flask, Hugging Face Transformers, NLP

Project Overview

This project is a web-based multilingual text translation tool that leverages advanced NLP models from Hugging Face to translate text across multiple languages. It is designed to efficiently handle both short texts and large documents while maintaining high accuracy.

Features

Real-time Translation: Translate text in multiple languages through a Flask web interface.

High Accuracy: Data-driven text processing pipelines achieve 95% translation accuracy.

Document-Level Parsing: Optimized parser improves translation speed by 50% for large documents.

Scalable: Can handle both single sentences and large document translations efficiently.

Key Achievements

Engineered pipelines for efficient and accurate translation.

Implemented document-level parsing, reducing processing time by 50%.

Designed scalable and user-friendly web interface for real-time translations.
